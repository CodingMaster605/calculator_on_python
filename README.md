Python 3 Calculator!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

To use this Python Calculator, you can clone this repo on VS Code or just download the ZIP file and extract it to a Folder!

I have removed the Exponent from this Calculator, but if you want to add it... You can type this code at the bottom inside the ''' triple quotes!

Here is the code:

```
------------------------------------------------------------------
{n1} ** {n2} is: {exponent}
------------------------------------------------------------------
```

You can star this Repo if you like the calculator! ðŸŒŸ
